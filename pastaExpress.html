	<h2>CLIENT BACKGROUND</h2> Pasta Express Italian Kitchen has been a favorite for families in Springfield, Missouri for over 20 years. They pride themselves in being able to quickly serve high quality foods at a reasonable price. Pasta Express is committed to the community and take on many fundraising activities throughout the year. They are able to accommodate all groups including families, friends, and co-workers. Pasta Express offers a casual atmosphere that is perfect for all events and occasions. Whether customers are wanting takeout, delivery, catering, or dining room service, Pasta Express does it all every day of the week. 
			<br>

	<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2> 
	The main marketing objective of Pasta Express is to bring people together for a quality meal while providing quick service to their customers. Pasta Express attracts families and older crowds but have interest in expanding their reach to college students and millennials. They are wanting to transition their Republic location from a full-service restaurant to a self-service restaurant and need a remodel that will match the flow of this new structure.<br><br>
	With the needs of the organization in mind, two key campaign objectives are identified; to remodel Pasta Express into a self-service restaurant while keeping an authentic feel, and to increase Pasta Express’s media presence to bring in millennials and younger families. To do this, we will be focusing on sales promotion, digital marketing, and public relations. More specifically, we will be directing our efforts in remodeling and then promoting the remodel by holding an event— a grand re-opening— advertised through social media and news releases. These three channels were chosen because they encourage customers to be engaged and has a potentially large reach at a low-cost.
	<br>

	<h2>CREATIVE STRATEGIES</h2> Our message is: “Different feel, same great meal!” We will be integrating the channels to cohesively communicate this message. The slogan communicates how Pasta Express will “feel” different with the new interior remodeling. Nevertheless, it ensures the older audience and regulars, who may not be fond of change, that their favorite meal will not be changed.  Our goal is help Pasta Express stand out from its competitors by offering its customers a dining experience different than other Italian Restaurants in Springfield, Missouri. <br>
